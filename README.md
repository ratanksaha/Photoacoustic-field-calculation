# Photoacoustic-field-calculation
Photoacoustic field calculation with Born-series methods
This is a Matlab program that calculates the Photoacoustic field at various frequencies generated by a source using the Born-series methods (known as the Traditional Born Series and Convergent Born Series) in two dimensions. The source is assumed to be a circular disc. The program needs the following inputs to run.
Inputs-
Size of the computational domain, Nx=Ny=?
Grid size, dx=dy=?
Center of the computational domain, typically, Nmid=0.5*Nx+1
Width of the PML in terms of grid points, PML=?
Position of the detector in terms of grid points, Ndetect=?
Number of frequency points at which amplitudes of the PA field will be calculated, NFFT=?
Error tolerance, derror=?
Speed of sound in the ambient medium, vf=?
Speed of sound in the source region, vs=?
Radius of the source, a=? (assuming it is a circular disc)
Maximum number of iterations, MaxIT=?

Output-
Shirfn- It is a 2D matrix that retains the pressure field after the steady state is reached (assuming the method converges within 2000 iterations). The program stops after 2000 iterations.
